**Aspiring Data Analyst with a Passion for Insights**

---

Hello! I'm Precious Mohale, an enthusiastic data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, MySQL, Excel, and Power BI. My journey began with a fascination for turning raw data into actionable insights. Here's what I bring to the table:

1. **Python Proficiency**:
   - I've honed my Python skills by working on data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. Whether it's pandas for data manipulation or matplotlib for visualizations, Python is my go-to tool.

2. **MySQL Magic**:
   - SQL is my playground! I've crafted complex queries, optimized databases, and explored relational data models. MySQL is where I feel at home.

3. **Excel Wizardry**:
   - Spreadsheets don't scare me; they excite me! From pivot tables to VLOOKUPs, I've tamed Excel for data wrangling and reporting.

4. **Power BI Passion**:
   - Power BI is my canvas for creating interactive dashboards. I've visualized trends, built data models, and turned numbers into compelling stories.
