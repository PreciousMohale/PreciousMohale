**Aspiring Data Analyst with a Passion for Insights**

Hello! I'm Precious Mohale, an enthusiastic data scientist with a strong foundation in Python, MySQL, Excel, and Power BI. My journey began with a fascination for turning raw data into actionable insights. Here's what I bring to the table:

1. **Python**:
   - I've honed my Python skills by working on data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

2. **MySQL**:
   - I've crafted complex queries, optimized databases, and explored relational data models.

3. **Excel**:
   - Spreadsheets excite me! Functions, Pivot tables, Dashboards, I utilise Excel for data wrangling and reporting.

4. **Power BI**:
   - Power BI is my canvas for creating interactive dashboards. I've visualized trends, built data models, and turned numbers into compelling stories.
